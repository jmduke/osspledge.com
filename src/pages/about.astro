        <h1>About the Pledge</h1>

        <p
          >Open Source Pledge is a group of companies with a shared commitment to paying the maintainers of the Open
          Source software we all consume. Our goal is to establish a new social norm in the tech industry of companies
          paying Open Source maintainers, so that burnout and related security issues such as those in XZ and Log4j can
          become a thing of the past. Our new norm is a minimum of $2000 per year per developer on staff at our
          companies, to Open Source maintainers of each company’s choosing.</p
        >

        <p
          >The point of the Open Source Pledge is for companies to directly pay maintainers of Open Source projects they
          depend on,
          <a href="https://github.com/opensourcepledge/osspledge.com/issues/112">with no strings attached</a>.
          This is in addition to the code, developer time, and gifts-in-kind that many of our companies also contribute.
          Payments are made directly to maintainers — we never handle any funds.
          </p
        >

        <p
          >We want to promote companies that support a healthy Open Source ecosystem, which is why we're launching a
          major promotional campaign on October 8, including outdoor advertising in prime San Francisco and NYC
          locations. As part of this campaign, we will celebrate Open Source Pledge Innovators who who join us by
          September 24.</p
